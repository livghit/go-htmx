|ANNNDD STILLANNNDD STILL  This project is not aiming to become the next prodigy or some kind of shenanigans. It is supposed to be an implementation way ‚Äì not THE WAY ‚Äì between a Go backend that utilizes the Power of HTMX. I chose Fiber for the backend implementation out of pure interest, without taking real-world use, performance, and other considerations into account. I am aware that I could use only the standard lib, but I just have an interest in Fiber. Here a video that shows how powerfull the go standart lib can be :) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi9A6-xoOkA">Awsome Video about go and HTMX</a>|
